The measures included cutting off key Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system and freezing their U.S.-based assets. The European Union and the United Kingdom (Other State Actors) joined in implementing similar financial restrictions.

The sanctions affected multinational corporations such as Goldman Sachs (US) and Deutsche Bank (DE), which reduced their exposure to Russian assets. The restrictions remain in effect as of 2025 (Ongoing).""
